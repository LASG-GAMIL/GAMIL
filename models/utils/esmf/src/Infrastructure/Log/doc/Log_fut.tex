\subsection{Future Plans}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Expand use of LogPrint}

The eventual vision of the log is to replace the miscellaneous fortran {\tt
wirte} statements in the code with calls to {\tt MFM\_LogPrint}.  This would
allow for a more organized approach to collecting, and displaying diagnostic
output.  It could faciliate easier debugging by providing a common message
format.  Tools could be written to sift through this common output and
organize/display the resulting data.

\end{itemize}
