\section{Overview}

This utility provides an API for timing code sections and
for general hardware profiling.

The profiling portion of the library is built on the PCL \cite{pcl} utilities.
The use of the utilities may require the installation of special drivers to access
the profiling hardware registers.  These drivers come with the PCL distribution and
will be installed with the distribution.  More information on how to obtain and install
PCL is available on the PCL web site 
\htmladdnormallink{(http://www.kfa-juelich.de/zam/PCL)}{http://www.kfa-juelich.de/zam/PCL)}.
If PCL is not installed, the timing portion of the library will work, but the PCL options should not
be enabled in the call to {\tt ESMF\_TimerInit}.  If they are, an error will be generated.
