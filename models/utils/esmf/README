                                   README

        How to get and install the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)

================================================================================

The ESMF library source code is available for download at:

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=38089

Follow the directions on that webpage to access the ESMF CVS repository.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following platforms are supported: Alpha, IRIX64, IBM, Linux, Sun

Currently the following environment variables must be set:
ESMF_ARCH     alpha, IRIX, IRIX64, rs6000_sp, linux_pgi, linux_gnupgi, linux_lf95, solaris, solaris_hpc
ESMF_DIR      top-level ESMF directory

Build the library with the command:
 
  gmake BOPT=g 

for a debug version or

  gmake BOPT=O

for an optimized version.

To build and run C tests:

  gmake BOPT=g test_c

To build and run F90 tests:

  gmake BOPT=g test_f90

To build and run C tests (on a non-mpi machine):

  gmake BOPT=g test_cuni

To build and run F90 tests (on a non-mpi machine):

  gmake BOPT=g test_f90uni

Output files from the tests are directed to files in $ESMF_DIR/test${BOPT}/${ESMF_ARCH}
directories.

To build documentation:

  gmake dvi           ! Makes the dvi files
  gmake pdf           ! Makes the pdf files
  gmake html          ! Creates the html directory.
  gmake alldoc        ! Builds all the above documents.

To use the library from C/C++, link with the appropriate library executable 
under $ESMF_DIR/lib and include the "ESMC.h" file.


To use the library from F90, link with the appropriate library executable under
$ESMF_DIR/lib.  Create links to the modules mfm_timemgmt.mod and 
mfm_timemgmt_types.mod in your application build directory.  Modules are 
in the $ESMF_DIR/mod directory.  To include the library in application modules, 
USE the module MFM_TimeMgmt.

There is an install target which will copy the library and mod files to an
install location.  To invoke this target use:

  gmake BOPT=[O,g] ESMF_LIB_INSTALL=dir_for_lib ESMF_MOD_INSTALL=dir_for_mod_files install 

Some users may wish for the library to be built in a directory different from 
where the source code resides.  To do this, build using:
  
   gmake ESMF_BUILD=build_directory_here BOPT=[O,g]

The ESMF_BUILD variable gives an alternate path in which to place the libraries,
mod files and object files.  This variable defaults to ESMF_DIR.  If it is 
assigned another value, the ESMF_BUILD variable will need to be passed as
an additional argument to the the above make commands.  (Alternatively the variable
ESMF_BUILD can be set in the environment (using setenv or export) and then it
need not be passed to any make calls).
