# -trapuv initializes memory with NaNs, so that uninitialized errors are caught.

# For IRIX version less than 6.2, 
#         replace "-OPT:Olimit=5000" with "-OPT:fprop_limit=5000"
#	On Origin2000 Some Alice files are not compiled with -O3.
#	  replace -O3 with -O2 to compile these files.

#	IF your O2K has ip25 processor, please change
#       ip27 to ip25

# Some examples crash (ts/ex/tests/ex1f) with the cprop optimization

# For IRIX Release less than,6.2 the above should probably be replaced by
