#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  See ${ESMF_DIR}/docs/installation.html 
# for information on retrieving them.
#
# If you are lucky, you may have the DEC Alpha math library installed on 
# your machine. The library name is dxml, and it contains both BLAS and Lapack.

# Using prun:

# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software

# If you are using the MPICH 1.1 (or higher) implementation of MPI,
