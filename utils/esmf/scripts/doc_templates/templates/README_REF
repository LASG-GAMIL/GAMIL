================================================================================

This file describes how to create a basic reference manual using a set of 
templates.

A reference manual includes the parts shown in the table below.  Brackets []
indicate that a part is optional.  In the filenames, "comp" refers to the 
component or library that the whole reference manual or reference manual chapter
describes.  Components are often broken up into separate "classes" or modules, which are typically segregated into separate files.  Several classes or 
modules may be included in a single design document.

The structure of the reference manual accommodates the specification of
multiple language interfaces.  For now, only Fortran templates are 
actually included.

If some document parts (e.g., synopsis, architecture, references, glossary) 
are expanded for inclusion in the reference manual, this expanded version 
can replace earlier versions of the parts that were included in requirements, 
design and architecture documents.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part		Template File	    Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
document	<comp>_refdoc.tex   Document shell with software release number

synopsis        <comp>_syn.tex      Brief description of the software 
                                    function  

architecture    <comp>_arch.tex     Description of the computational 
                                    architecture, including layering strategy 
                                    and major internal components and classes

class           class_desc.tex      Short summary of class function 
description

class           class_rest.tex      List of class restrictions due to design
restrictions                        or implementation strategies

fortran files   prologue.F          Contain code headers instrumented for
                                    ProTeX; not included in document but used 
                                    to create it

fparameters     class_fparam.tex    Fortran flags and parameters, if any

fapi            class_fapi.tex      Fortran application program interface;
                                    this file should be generated from the
                                    prologue.F template using ProTeX

fexamples       class_fex.tex       Fortran examples

[c/c++ files]   prologue.c          Contain code headers instrumented for
                                    ProTeX; not included in document but used
                                    to create it

[cparameters]   class_cparam.tex    C/C++ flags and enum types, if any

[capi]          class_capi.tex      C/C++ application program interface;
                                    this file should be generated using ProTeX

[cexamples]     class_cex.tex       C/C++ examples

[glossary]      <comp>_glos.tex     Definitions, acronyms, abbreviations

[references]    <comp>_ref.bib      References

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a new reference manual, fill in the template files, duplicating and 
renaming the class files for each class in your component.  In 
<comp>_refdoc.tex, be sure to comment out the \input of any files you aren't 
including and specify the \input filenames of files that you are including.

Process prologue files using ProTeX:

	do_fprotex <class> <prologue.F[90]>
	
	Here <prologue.F[90]> is the name of the Fortran file with the 
        instrumented headers.
        This script will produce a LaTeX file called <class>_fapi.tex.

Build a dvi file from LaTeX documents:

	do_latex <comp> ref

Produce an html version of the documentation:

	do_l2h <comp> ref

The html files are placed in a directory called <comp>_refdoc.

The dvipdf tool can be used to produce a pdf:

	dvipdf <comp>_refdoc.dvi
