            Earth System Modeling Framework Document Templates

1. Introduction
   ------------

The "templates" directory contains a set of file templates for generating 
software-related documentation.  This documentation is modular and 
reusable.  For example, a file containing a glossary of terms related to a 
component may be included in a preliminary requirements document and may also 
be included in a user reference manual.  The templates target both computational 
and scientific documentation of software.  

This documentation approach is based on the LaTeX and ProTeX tools.  LaTeX
is a sophisticated character-based document preparation system that requires 
compilation.  Most of the files in the "templates" directory are LaTeX 
templates.  ProTeX is a Perl tool that processes C and Fortran code
headers, or prologues, and generates an interface specification 
in LaTeX form automatically.  The prologue templates show Fortran and C 
headers instrumented for use with ProTeX.  

The templates that are currently included are:

    Document                       Primary File              README
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Prologues (from NASA/DAO)      prologue.[F,C]            none
    Requirements document (LaTeX)  comp_reqdoc.tex           README_REQ
    Architecture document (LaTeX)  comp_archdoc.tex	     README_ARCH
    Design document (LaTeX)	   comp_desdoc.tex	     README_DES
    Reference manual               comp_refdoc.tex           README_REF    
    User's guide                   comp_usrdoc.tex           README_USR
    Physics                        comp_physdoc.tex          README_PHYS

The ProTeX script is also included.  It is slightly different than the
current distribution in order to accommodate the document format.
The ProTeX website:
http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/dao/software/ProTeX
has additional templates and examples.

The "examples" directory contains a number of sample documents that were 
created using the templates.  Links to the web-browsable form of these sample 
documents are included in the ESMF Software Developer's Guide Documentation 
Section.  Further discussion of the documents is also included in the 
Developer's Guide:

2. Implied development cycle
   -------------------------

These documents correspond to a staged development cycle in which requirements 
are generated first.  Next an overall architecture is specified that 
typically includes a layering strategy and a specification of how major 
components should interact.  Finally detailed design documents that contain 
interface specifications for individual classes and modules are generated.
These documents build on each other, so that requirements are folded into
architecture, and architecture is folded into design.

Reference and user manuals describe the API interface and how to build and 
run the software.

3. How to use the templates
   ------------------------

Set the environment variable DOC_DIR to the top-level directory in this packet,
e.g. $HOME/doc_templates.

Put the scripts in $DOC_DIR/templates/scripts in your path.

To start a new document, execute the script:

do_newdoc <component name> <document type>

The document type can be one of the following:

	req  - requirements document
	arch - architecture document
	des  - design document
	ref  - reference manual
	usr  - user's guide
        phys - physical description
	all  - templates and READMEs for all documents

If the directory does not exist, the script will create a new directory 
called <component name> and fill it with the appropriate document-specific
README and template files for the document type.

If the directory does exist, the script will add any additional files that
are needed to complete the new document.

See individual README's for further explanation on how to prepare specific
documents.
