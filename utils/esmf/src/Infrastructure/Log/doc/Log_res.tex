\subsection{Restrictions}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Printf type format strings}

All printf format strings are recognized by {\tt MFM\_LogPrint}.
However, you must use the {\tt ``\%lf''} (long float) format string to print a double,
since the underlying library has to know the specific type of each argument.
The usual {\tt ``\%f''} may be used to print a float.
\end{itemize}
