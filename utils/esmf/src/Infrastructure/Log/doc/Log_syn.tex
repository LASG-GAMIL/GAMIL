\section{Overview}

This utility provides an organized method for writing diagnostic
output.  In a large program
writing to {\tt STDOUT, STDERR} often results in a mass of output that
is either too cluttered to understand or that is lost due to pipe 
re-direction.  The log provides a message output channel that organizes
its output by the author, the time of writing, and the class of the 
message.  This opens the way for standard unix tools like {\tt grep, sort, cut}
and others to manipulate the output files (the output is guarenteed to show
up in a pre-designated place) to sort through the results and retrieve
the desired information.
